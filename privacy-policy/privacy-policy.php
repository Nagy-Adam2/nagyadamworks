        </ul>
        <p class="leadf">For technical reasons, I undertake to register the withdrawal of consent within a day, but I would like to draw your attention to the fact that in order to fulfill my legal obligations or assert my legitimate interests, I may process certain data even after the withdrawal of consent.</p>
        <p class="leadf mb-5">In the event of the use of misleading personal data, or if one of our visitors commits a crime or attacks my system related to my website, I will immediately delete the data of that visitor at the same time as canceling their registration, and - if necessary - I will preserve them for the duration of the establishment of civil liability or the conduct of criminal proceedings.</p>


        <h3 class="mb-4">14. What do you need to know about my data processing for direct marketing and newsletter purposes?</h3>

        <p class="leadf">You can give your consent to the use of your personal data for marketing purposes by making a statement during registration or later, by modifying your personal data stored on the newsletter and/or direct marketing registration interface (i.e. by clearly declaring your intention to consent). In this case - until you withdraw your consent - I will process your data for direct marketing and/or sending newsletters and will send you advertising and other mailings as well as information and offers and/or forward newsletters (Grtv. § 6).</p>
        <p class="leadf">You can give your consent to direct marketing and the newsletter together or separately, and you can withdraw it/them free of charge and at any time.</p>
        <p class="leadf">In all cases, I consider cancellation of registration as withdrawal of consent. I do not interpret withdrawal of consent to data management for direct marketing and/or newsletter purposes as withdrawal of data management consent related to my website. How is this? what and on what basis do I keep it if the newsletter consent has been revoked? In the case of contributions, each contribution is for a specific purpose, so registering tomorrow and signing up for the newsletter are two separate purposes, two separate databases, the two cannot be related.</p>
        <p class="leadf mb-5">I undertake the registration of the withdrawal or cancellation of individual consents for technical reasons - with a deadline of one day.</p>


        <h3 class="mb-4">15. Other data management issues</h3>

        <p class="leadf">I can only forward your data within the framework defined by law, and in the case of our data processors, I ensure by stipulating contractual conditions that they cannot use your personal data for purposes contrary to your consent. More information can be found in point 2.</p>
        <p class="leadf">I do not transfer data abroad.</p>
        <p class="leadf">The court, the prosecutor's office and other authorities (e.g. the police, the tax office, the National Data Protection and Freedom of Information Authority) may contact you to provide information, provide data or make documents available. In these cases, I have to fulfill my obligation to provide data, but only to the extent absolutely necessary to achieve the purpose of the request.</p>
        <p class="leadf">If there are contributors and employees involved in data management and/or data processing, they are entitled to know your personal data to a predetermined extent - subject to the burden of confidentiality.</p>
        <p class="leadf">I protect your personal data with appropriate technical and other measures, as well as ensure the security and availability of the data, as well as protect them from unauthorized access, alteration, damage, disclosure and any other unauthorized use.</p>
        <p class="leadf">As part of the technical measures, I use encryption, password protection and anti-virus software. However, I draw your attention to the fact that data transmission via the Internet cannot be considered a fully secure data transmission. I will do my best to make the processes as safe as possible, however, I cannot take full responsibility for data transmission through my website, but I will observe strict regulations regarding the data received in order to ensure the security of your data and to prevent illegal access.</p>
        <p class="leadf mb-5">Regarding security issues, I ask for your help in carefully saving your access password for my website and not sharing this password with anyone.</p>
